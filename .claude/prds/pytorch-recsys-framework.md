# PRD: PyTorch Recommendation System Framework

## Executive Summary

This PRD outlines the development of a PyTorch-based deep learning framework specifically designed for building and evaluating sequential recommendation systems. The framework will provide modular components for data processing, model implementation, and efficient serving, targeting ML researchers and engineers who need to quickly prototype and deploy transformer-based recommendation models for sequences up to 1000 items.

Key differentiators include optimized attention mechanisms for long sequences, modular architecture for easy extensibility, and built-in support for efficient cloud deployment with quantization and pruning.

## Problem Statement

### Current Pain Points
- Existing recommendation frameworks lack focus on sequential modeling with long context windows
- Most frameworks don't provide optimized attention mechanisms for sequences beyond 200-300 items
- Limited modular design makes it difficult to experiment with new architectures
- Gap between research prototypes and production-ready serving solutions
- No unified framework supporting both retrieval and ranking evaluation metrics

### Why Now?
- Growing demand for session-based and long-term user modeling in recommendations
- Recent advances in efficient attention mechanisms (linear attention, sparse patterns)
- Increasing need for fast experimentation cycles in recommendation research
- Production requirements for low-latency serving at scale

## User Stories

### Primary Personas

**ML Researcher (Dr. Sarah)**
- Wants to quickly implement and compare sequential recommendation models
- Needs to experiment with different attention mechanisms and sequence lengths
- Requires standardized evaluation protocols for fair model comparison
- Values reproducible results and clean modular code

**ML Engineer (Alex)**
- Needs to take research models to production quickly
- Requires efficient serving with sub-100ms latency for millions of users
- Wants built-in support for model optimization (quantization, pruning)
- Values easy integration with existing ML infrastructure

### User Journeys

**Research Workflow:**
1. Load and preprocess sequential interaction data
2. Implement custom model using modular components
3. Train model with optimized attention for long sequences
4. Evaluate using standard retrieval/ranking metrics
5. Compare against baseline models (SASRec)
6. Export model for production deployment

**Production Deployment:**
1. Import trained model from research phase
2. Apply post-training quantization and pruning
3. Deploy to cloud serving infrastructure
4. Monitor inference latency and throughput
5. A/B test against existing production models

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

## Constraints & Assumptions

### Technical Constraints

- Maximum sequence length limited by GPU memory (target: 1000 items)

### Timeline Constraints
- MVP delivery in 2 weeks (sprint-based development)
- Research models (SASRec, TransAct) prioritized over serving optimizations
- Evaluation framework must be completed for MVP validation

- No dedicated DevOps support for serving infrastructure

### Assumptions
- Users have basic PyTorch and recommendation systems knowledge
- Standard recommendation datasets are sufficient for initial validation
